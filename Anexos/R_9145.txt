    <p><img src="http://images.naturalresourceinvestor.net/img/n/natmedia/020509/image004.jpg" width="412" height="238" hspace="10" align="left" />I met with Daniel Brauser, president, CEO and CFO at the Cambridge House mining show last week. This is a very exciting &ldquo;gold mining&rdquo; company. I put quotes around &ldquo;gold mining&rdquo; for a good reason. Money4Gold is &ldquo;mining&rdquo; gold, not in the traditional sense, but by recycling jewelry that is being sold in exchange for cash.</p>
    <p>Here is how it works. When you want to exchange some broken or unwanted jewelry, you contact Money4Gold. They send out a postage-paid envelope that you use to ship your jewelry in. As soon as the Money4Gold refinery receives it, it is assayed and a check is cut and mailed immediately to you. The check is based on the amount of gold or silver or platinum group metals contained in your shipment and the closing price of the relevant metal at the end of the day it is received. As soon as your check is cashed, Money4Gold has your unwanted precious metals melted down, at which time they sell it on the market.</p>
    <p>Of course, pawnbrokers do this sort of business. But it&rsquo;s much easier to sell your items without having to hunt down a pawnbroker and transporting them to the pawnshop yourself. Also, Money4Gold has an added advantage in that it has a close relationship with a refinery that gives it a cost advantage over competitors.</p>
    <p>The potential precious metals recycling business is huge&mdash;it&rsquo;s the second-biggest source of gold, silver, and platinum. An estimated $9 billion is spent on jewelry every year in the U.S. alone. And worldwide, between 23% and 25% of the gold supply comes from recycling; almost 30 million ounces of gold came to the global market from recycling in 2007, for a $20 billion annual market. </p>
    <p>A couple of players have dominated the precious metals recycling markets over the past few years, but they seem to have become fat and lazy. You no doubt have seen them advertising on television. In fact, the top companies in this business are among the most frequent television advertisers on the market. </p>
    <p>Money4Gold&rsquo;s management has had a superb track record in business and they are young Turks who have mastered the Internet as well as anyone has in business. So far, in its short history, Money4Gold has done a spectacular job in using the Net to ramp up its business. In fact it is considerably ahead of where management expected to be in this quarter, which is only the second quarter of its existence. However, management also understands that it must use television to begin to rival its competitors. And I believe this young, innovative management team is going to shake some people up real good! </p>
    <p>How are they going to do that? I can&rsquo;t say much at this time because it is not public knowledge. But in speaking to management, I believe you might expect a very high-profile household-name celebrity to come on board to endorse Money4Gold in the near future. That will be coordinated with a major television campaign to take advantage of this person&rsquo;s celebrity status. To help the company design and launch its television campaign, a top advertising agency will be used to ensure that the maximum benefit of this superstar celebrity is derived. </p>
    <p>Q4 2008 numbers will be out over the next several weeks. We are expecting sales for the quarter to be around $900,000. Nothing spectacular, that is for sure. However, longer term as Money4Gold begins to use the most effective advertising media to promote its business, and assuming it is able to get that top celebrity to join the effort, it is not difficult to see Money4Gold kick up its sales to at least the level of a top private company in this space. And that company is doing an estimated $150 million per year. We believe a profit margin in the 30% to 35% range is very possible. Actually it generated an operating profit margin of 41% during its first quarter of operation, but that was when it marketed its services exclusively via Internet. We would expect TV advertising could initially eat into those margins, but it will most certainly allow the company to ramp up its business&mdash;big time especially if it gets a high profile personality on board as we expect it will. But if we assume a 30% operating margin on $150 million, that would bring annual operating cash flows of $45 million compared to the company&rsquo;s current market cap of approximately $35 million. Obviously with this kind of growth, we would expect a substantially larger market cap. Our expectations for this year? We are hopeful of at least a double in the price of this stock and if a high profile personality is brought on board, we think that could happen fairly quickly.</p>
    <p>Money4Gold&rsquo;s Perfect Timing</p>
    <p>Your editor thinks we may well be heading into a period of time when the U.S. economy is at the start of a Great Depression that could in fact be &ldquo;The Greater Depression.&rdquo; We hope we are wrong about that, for all the obvious reasons. However, if we are right, the need to sell non-essential items like jewelry will become very prominent. Those billions upon billions of dollars of jewelry purchased over past decades may suddenly be sold on to the markets, en masse, causing Money4Gold&rsquo;s business as well as that of its competitors to explode in exceptionally rapid growth. We do not advocate seeking to profit from the misery of others. However, we also think that people who have handled their affairs responsibly by avoiding excessive debt, will find themselves in a position to strengthen their financial condition by holding their gold and/or buying shares in gold mining companies, Money4Gold being a unique example. </p>
    <p>In time, we think fiat money will self destruct and people who sold their jewelry thinking they were making a good choice will realize they might have been better off had they held on to it. At the same time, to the extent selling unwanted or broken jewelry raises life-sustaining cash by funding food for the table or renting shelter overhead, we strongly suggest Money4Gold is providing a valuable service. </p>
    <p>We think Money4Gold is a very exciting and unique gold-silver-platinum group metals company. It is &ldquo;green&rdquo; in the sense that it produces these products without environmental concerns of most mining firms. And we think its growth prospects are superb, especially given the youthful, high energy levels of its young but talented management team. We do not have a target price in mind for Money4Gold just yet, but let me say quite frankly, I will be very disappointed if we don&rsquo;t see a double in the price of these shares over the next year. </p>
